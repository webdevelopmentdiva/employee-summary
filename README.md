# employee-summary

I created an application that is meant for the manager of a software engineering team. It will be used to manage and display their teams basic information. This will give them quick access to their employees emails and GitHub profiles.

This command line application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
